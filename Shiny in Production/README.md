# Shiny in Production

## Overview

This repository contains the code and materials for the Shiny in Secondary Education talk presented at the Shiny in Production Conference. The talk explores the use of Shiny, a web application framework for R, in the to explore statistical concepts to GCSE students. It demonstrates how Shiny apps can be used to teach students statistical concepts in an interactive and engaging way.

The talk provided at Shiny in Production conference contained an iframe with the 
a local version of the application. Needed to strip this and anytime I went to deploy the 
talk it keeps freezing - so a lesson learnt in needing to optimise quarto presentations for 
production!

A PDF slides version of the slides are available on the repo and the code in case any one
wonder how I achieved anything. It's very messy, I only really do ad hoc presentations
so the file structure needs a complete overhaul and creating re-usable components

Enjoy!
